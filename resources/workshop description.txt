[h1]EU4 To Vic2 Converter[/h1]

Welcome to the EU4 to Vic2 Converter project! The goal of this project is to allow a Europa Universalis 4 campaign to be transferred and continued in Victoria 2, so you may continue your game uninterrupted, from 1444 to 1936, and further using our other converters from Crusader Kings 3 and to Hearts of Iron 4.

Running a continuous campaign from CK2 all the way to HoI4 is called running a [b]mega-campaign[/b].

[h2]The converter is not a mod - it is a mod producing [i]application[/i][/h2]
[list]
[*] Stable release of the converter currently supports EU4 1.30 and Victoria 2 3.0.4. EU4 DLCs are optional, both Vic2 expansions [b]are mandatory[/b].
[*] Development release of the converter is compatible with EU4 1.30
[*] This mod is not intended to be enabled in game. It is only a [i]delivery vehicle[/i] for the converter's download link.
[*] You can also download the converter directly from our [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/eu4-to-vic2-converter-release-thread.973026/]forums thread[/url] or from Github.
[/list]

[h3]Setting up the converter.[/h3]
To set up the converter, you’ll need to follow the simple steps below:
[olist]
[*] Subscribe to the this mod.
[*] If the mod does not immediately begin downloading, you may need to start EU4 launcher to trigger the download.
[*] Go to your mod folder (usually [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\236850\392447667[/i], or elsewhere if you moved your steam library)
[*] Inside it find and open [i]downloadLink.txt[/i]. 
[*] Within that file are direct links to the converter's stable and development versions. Pick one and download it. Development versions are fresher and usually better.
[*] Unzip the downloaded converter by right-clicking on it and selecting [i]Extract All…[/i]
[*] Finally, go to the extracted converter's directory and fire it up by running [i]ConverterFrontend.exe[/i].
[/olist]

If you downloaded the converter directly from forums or github, you only need to execute steps 6 and 7.

[h2]How does it work?[/h2]
Every converter has a detailed documentation available at its [url=https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/Europa_Universalis_IV_to_Victoria_II_Converter]wiki page[/url].
Very generally, it takes your Europa Universalis 4 [b]saved game[/b] and converts it into a Victoria 2 [b]mod[/b].
You then have to [b]enable that mod[/b] when starting Vic2 launcher:

[olist]
[*] Create a new playset in the launcher.
[*] Add the conversion mod into the new playset, along with other mods you want to use (such as graphical ones)
[*] On the Home page of the launcher, make sure the new playset is enabled and selected before pressing Play.
[/olist]

[h2]Troubleshooting and Suggestions[/h2]

We are always open to suggestions on improving our converters and will gladly help you out if you hit a problem. 

Best place for discussion on improving the converters are our [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/eu4-to-vic2-converter-release-thread.973026/]Paradox forum release thread[/url] and [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/the-eu4-to-v2-converter-development-thread-not-for-troubleshooting.707362/]development thread[/url].

When resolving issues we will always need if your conversion's [i][b]log.txt[/b][/i]. You can find it in your converter's folder after conversion. Come to the release thread linked above and upload your log.txt there, along with a detailed description of your problem. We may need additional data like your running savegame or mods used, which you can also upload to the forums directly.
