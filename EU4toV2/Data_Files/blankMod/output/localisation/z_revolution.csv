EVTDESC100000024;The revolution has happened. Through the peasant's strugle, the socialist republican model claims true democracy for the people, without manipulation from the corrupt bourgeoise or the despotic nobility. The people have endured and prevailed, proving the legitimacy of this political view. Through a unified society under a single social class, socialism finds a strong base to spread beyond their borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC100000025;Never again will the elite's yoke be allowed to return to our people, and it's the government's duty to ensure that. The freedom of our citizens depend on the strength of our state to contain reactionary attempts to take back the power. As such, any subversion of this people's republic is a direct attack to the people themselves, and shall not be tolarated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC100200024;The old order has been overthrown in our nation. Enlightened ideals have sprung a new age, where petty despots who don't uphold the best interest of our citizens don't have a place no more. Rule by law, valuing inividual freedom, equal rights to all men, and mutual cooperation between individuals unshackled from the state, are all for the betterment of our society. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
