# This file defines culture, religions, government, civilized and capital for dead nations.
# These will override whatever we loaded in vanilla history files. What isn't listed will default to either history entries or won't be set, depending on case.
# Tag is mandatory, the rest is not. Only one of each is allowed:
# tag, primary_culture, religion, government, civilized, capital, add_accepted_culture

# Usually we default to "dummy" culture and "dummy_religion" religion, which automatically solve in-game (e.g. if ABC is mostly French, it'll become French); to absolute_monarchy and uncivilized. Of course, no extra accepted culture is added.
