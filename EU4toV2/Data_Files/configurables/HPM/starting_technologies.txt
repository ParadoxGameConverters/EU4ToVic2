# As soon as there are at least two civilized countries, they receive normalized 
# technology group score ranging from -1 to 1. Below are technologies assigned
# at each technological treshold. Countries that score 1.0 will receive everything
# on the group's list.
# Don't list inventions, every tech will also assign all inventions unlocked by it.
# All three fields are mandatory - a country with army score of -0.2 or more will get
# post_napoleonic_thought + related invention post_napoleonic_army_doctrine.
