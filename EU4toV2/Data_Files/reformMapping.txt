# forcegov is the government type this reform forces. For conflicting cases
# e.g. american_republic (democracy) with strengthen_executive_powers_reform 
# (presidential_dictatorship) the latter will always override the former.
# Legitimate targets are:
# proletarian_dictatorship, presidential_dictatorship, bourgeois_dictatorship,
# fascist_dictatorship, absolute_monarchy, prussian_constitutionalism,
# hms_government, democracy, theocracy
# If reform does not change government, leave blank.

# Order, liberty and equality, once combined across all selected reforms, define
# socio-political reforms enabled at game start. Ranges -1 to 1.
