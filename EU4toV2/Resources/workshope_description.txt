[h1]EU4 To Vic2 Converter[/h1]

Welcome to the EU4 to Vic2 Converter project! The goal of this project is to allow a Europa Universalis 4 campaign to be transferred and continued in Victoria 2, so you may continue your game uninterrupted, from 1444 to 1936, and further using our other converters from Crusader Kings 3 and to Hearts of Iron 4.

Running a continuous campaign from CK2 all the way to HoI4 is called running a [b]mega-campaign[/b].

[h2]The converter is not a mod - it is a mod producing [i]application[/i][/h2]
[list]
[*] Stable release of the converter currently supports EU4 1.30 and Victoria 2 3.0.4. EU4 DLCs are optional, both Vic2 expansions [b]are mandatory[/b].
[*] Development release of the converter is compatible with EU4 1.30
[*] This mod is not intended to be enabled in game. It is only a [i]delivery vehicle[/i] for the converter's download link.
[*] You can also download the converter directly from our [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/eu4-to-vic2-converter-release-thread.973026/]forums thread[/url] or from Github.
[/list]

[h3]Setting up the converter.[/h3]
To set up the converter, you’ll need to follow the simple steps below:
[olist]
[*] Subscribe to the this mod.
[*] If the mod does not immediately begin downloading, you may need to start EU4 launcher to trigger the download.
[*] Go to your mod folder (usually [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\236850\392447667[/i], or elsewhere if you moved your steam library)
[*] Inside it find and open [i]downloadLink.txt[/i]. 
[*] Within that file are direct links to the converter's stable and development versions. Pick one and download it. Development versions are fresher and usually better.
[*] Unzip the downloaded converter by right-clicking on it and selecting [i]Extract All…[/i]
[*] Finally, go to the extracted converter's directory and fire it up by running [i]ConverterFrontend.exe[/i].
[/olist]

If you downloaded the converter directly from forums or github, you only need to execute steps 6 and 7.

[h2]How does it work?[/h2]
Every converter has a detailed documentation available at its [url=https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/Europa_Universalis_IV_to_Victoria_II_Converter]wiki page[/url].
Very generally, it takes your Europa Universalis 4 [b]saved game[/b] and converts it into a Victoria 2 [b]mod[/b].
You then have to [b]enable that mod[/b] when starting Vic2 launcher:

[olist]
[*] Start the Vic2 Launcher.
[*] Select the converted mod.
[*] Click [i]Start Victoria 2[/i].
[/olist]

[h2]Troubleshooting and Suggestions[/h2]

We are always open to suggestions on improving our converters and will gladly help you out if you hit a problem. 

Best place for discussion on improving the converters are our [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/eu4-to-vic2-converter-release-thread.973026/]Paradox forum release thread[/url] and [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/the-eu4-to-v2-converter-development-thread-not-for-troubleshooting.707362/]development thread[/url].

When resolving issues we will always need if your conversion's [i][b]log.txt[/b][/i]. You can find it in your converter's folder after conversion. Come to the release thread linked above and upload your log.txt there, along with a detailed description of your problem. We may need additional data like your running savegame or mods used, which you can also upload to the forums directly.

Keep in mind Steam discussion below is [b]not suited[/b] to troubleshooting as you cannot upload files we need.
